# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_HR_DATASET

During my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I worked on an SQL-based project using an HR dataset to derive meaningful insights for business analytics. I began by cleaning and preparing the data—removing duplicates, correcting data types, and establishing relationships between key tables such as Employees, Departments, and Jobs. I wrote optimized SQL queries to analyze crucial HR metrics, including average salary by department, employee distribution by job role, and recent hiring trends. This project deepened my understanding of data cleaning, relational database management, and SQL-driven workforce analysis, with all scripts available on GitHub for reference and further development.
